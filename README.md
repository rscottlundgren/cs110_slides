## Lecture Slides for the Introduction to Computing (CS110) Course at UMB

In this repository you will find the LaTeX Beamer based slides I have prepared for the Introduction to Computing (CS110) course I teach at UMB (University of Massachusetts Boston). The references for the slides are [CS for All](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/) by Christine Alvarado, Zachary Dodds, Geoff Kuenning, and Ran Libeskind-Hadas, and [Introduction to Programming in Python: An Interdisciplinary Approach](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Python-Interdisciplinary-Approach/dp/0134076435/) by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne, and Robert Dondero.

To compile each TeX file to a PDF, run the following command:

```bash
> pdflatex <TeX filename>
```

The TeX files need [`slides.sty`](https://github.com/swamiiyer/misc.git) to compile.

The script `nupslides` converts a PDF to a form suitable for printing (four slides per page). To convert a PDF, run the following command:

```bash
> nupslides <PDF filename>
```
